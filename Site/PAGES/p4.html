                <h2>Roronin Kenshin The Final</h2>
                <br>Keishi Ohtomo
                <p>Rurouni Kenshin (Japanese: るろうに剣心, Hepburn: Rurōni Kenshin) 
                    (also known as Rurouni Kenshin: Origins in North America) is a 2012 
                    Japanese period action-adventure film based on the manga of the same
                     name written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. Directed by Keishi
                      Ōtomo, the film stars Takeru Satoh and Emi Takei. It focuses on 
                      fictional events that take place during the early Meiji period in 
                      Japan, telling the story of a wanderer named Himura Kenshin, formerly
                       known as the assassin Hitokiri Battōsai. After participating in the 
                       Bakumatsu war, Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering 
                       protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders 
                       he once committed.</p>
                    <p>Rumors circulated of a live-action adaptation of the manga before 
                        it was announced. The Sankei Sports newspaper reported that the staff 
                        aimed to release the film internationally and eventually make a series. 
                        This was the first live-action adaptation of the manga. During the production, 
                        Nobuhiro offered his ideas for the movie, which were used in the film. 
                        The film was distributed internationally by Warner Bros.
                        Rurouni Kenshin was theatrically released on August 25, 2012, in Japan, grossing 
                        over $36 million in that country and over $60 million worldwide as of November 2012. 
                        The film was licensed for distribution in over 60 countries in Europe, Latin America 
                        and Asia. The movie premiered in North America as an opening selection for the 2012 
                        LA EigaFest on December 14, 2012.
                        On June 14, 2016, Funimation Films announced that they acquired the rights to the 
                        film, as well as its sequels Kyoto Inferno and The Legend Ends.[citation needed] 
                        The film hit North American theatres in August 2016 with an English Dub.</p>

                <h2>Don't Give Up On Me </h2>
                <br>Andy Grammer
                <p>Even though the title (“Don’t Give Up On Me”) may insinuate otherwise, the primary sentiment 
                    expressed in this song is not one where the singer is asking for support, even though he does 
                    conclude the chorus on such a note. Rather he is mainly stating his undying willingness to be 
                    there for someone else, specifically his ‘lover’. This includes his resolve to remain present 
                    no matter what she may be going through, including “waiting for” her for an unspecified period 
                    of time, which is actually symbolic of exercising patience regardless of the challenges she may 
                    face. Indeed even when he is ‘down to his last breath’, he intends to be there for her.
                    So as an act of reciprocation, he is asking that she also “not give up” on him. Thus it reads as 
                    if he is touting his undying commitment to her to rationalize her showing him the same in return.
                    So once again, the majority of the lyrics on this song are not centered on the singer requesting 
                    his lover’s everlasting support per se. Or if they are, as the title insinuates, then he goes 
                    about doing so in a roundabout fashion by rather focusing on his endless love for her.</p>

                <p>Aura Kingdom, also known as Fantasy Frontier Online (Chinese: 幻想神域) in Taiwan and Hong Kong and 
                    Innocent World in Japan, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game made by the Taiwanese
